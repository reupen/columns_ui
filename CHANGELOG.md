# Change log

## 3.4.0-alpha.1

### Features

- An option for playlist view group headings to stay in view when scrolling
  vertically was added.
  [[#1586](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1586),
  [#1594](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1594)]

- An option to enable smooth (animated) scrolling was added.
  [[#1599](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1599),
  [#1604](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1604),
  [#1605](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1605),
  [#1607](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1607),
  [#1609](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1609),
  [#1612](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1612),
  [#1615](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1615),
  [#1622](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1622)]

  This affects the playlist view, playlist switcher, Filter panel, Item details
  and Item properties. The option is located on the Setup tab on the root
  Columns UI preferences page.

  Some consistency improvements were made to mouse wheel handling as part of
  this change.

- CPU usage when moving the mouse over the playlist and other built-in list
  views was reduced. [[#1585](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1585),
  [#1590](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1590),
  [#1591](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1591),
  [#1613](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1613)]

- The built-in spectrum analyser visualisation now renders in a background
  thread, allowing rendering to continue when the main thread is blocked (such
  as when interacting with parts of the main window title bar).
  [[#1608](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1608)]

  Improvements were also made to allow the visualisation to render at a higher
  frame rate.

- A main menu item, **View** › **Lock window size**, was added.
  [[#1595](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1595)]

  When enabled, the main window cannot be resized using its borders. It can
  still be maximised or
  [snapped](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/snap-your-windows-885a9b1e-a983-a3b1-16cd-c531795e6241#windowsversion=windows_11).

- When the **View** › **Transparent window** command is added to the Buttons
  toolbar as a button, the button now appears pressed when main window
  transparency is enabled.
  [[#1595](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1595)]

- Some options in Preferences were renamed for clarity and simplicity.
  [[#1611](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1611)]

### Bug fixes

- Ellipses for truncated text were reinstated when using tab characters to
  create columns or right-align text where this is supported.
  [[#1589](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1589)]

  This is intended to restore the behaviour of versions before 3.0.0.

- A bug where the ‘Configure panel…’ button on the Layout preferences tab did
  not work for the root panel was fixed.
  [[#1617](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1617)]

  This fix is only relevant when the root panel has a configuration dialogue.

- A bug where, when the built-in spectrum analyser visualisation was the root
  panel in the layout, its context menu items did not appear when right-clicking
  on the panel in the main window was fixed.
  [[#1619](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1619)]

  This fix also applies to any other panels that rely on the parent container to
  show their context menu items.

### Internal changes

- Some code was cleaned up.
  [[#1592](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1592),
  [#1598](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1598)]

## 3.3.0

- There were no changes from version 3.3.0-rc.1.

## 3.3.0-rc.1

### Features

- On the Colours and fonts preferences page, the Colours and Fonts tabs now
  remember the last selected element the next time the tab is opened.
  [[#1566](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1566)]

### Bug fixes

- A bug where the playlist view may not have shown tooltips as expected when
  `$set_format()` was used in a style script was fixed.
  [[#1568](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1568)]

- Newlines are now stripped from text in built-in list views and the status bar
  instead of only the first line of text being shown.
  [[#1569](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1569),
  [#1571](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1571)]

  This is intended to restore the behaviour present prior to version 3.0.0.

- Newlines are now preserved and handled correctly in tooltips in built-in list
  views. [[#1570](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1570)]

  Additionally, the maximum number of code points shown in list view tooltips
  was increased to 2048.

- Tooltips in built-in list views are now positioned so that they are not
  off-screen if they extend beyond the dimensions of the top-level window that
  the list view is in. [[#1570](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1570)]

- A problem where a message mentioning that ‘The operation is unsupported’ was
  logged to the console when loading artwork images in the BMP format was fixed.
  [[#1560](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1560),
  [#1567](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1567)]

- A possible error when the Artwork view reinitialises Direct3D and Direct2D
  resources was fixed. [[#1561](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1561)]

## 3.3.0-beta.2

### Bug fixes

- A bug in beta 1 causing playlist view style scripts to be evaluated
  incorrectly was fixed.
  [[#1557](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1557)]

## 3.3.0-beta.1

### Features

- Support for the `$set_format()`, `$reset_format()` and `%default_font_size%`
  title formatting functions and fields was added to the playlist view, playlist
  switcher, Filter panel, status bar and status pane.
  [[#1529](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1529),
  [#1530](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1530),
  [#1531](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1531),
  [#1532](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1532),
  [#1533](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1533),
  [#1536](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1536),
  [#1542](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1542),
  [#1547](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1547)]

  These functions and fields behave as they do in Item details and allow text
  styling to be changed for specific parts of text. Note that `$set_format()`
  does not affect item heights, which is fixed based on the size of the font
  configured on the Colours and fonts preferences page and the vertical item
  padding setting where available. See
  [Text styling](https://columns-ui.readthedocs.io/page/other/text-styling.html)
  for full documentation for the functions and some examples of how they can be
  used.

  Additionally, `%default_font_size%` has been modified universally to return
  the font size to one decimal place instead of rounding to the nearest whole
  number.

- ‘Tools’ menus were added below the playlist switcher, status bar and status
  pane title formatting edit fields in Preferences, providing access to title
  formatting help and the `$set_format()` code snippet generator.
  [[#1546](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1546)]

- In Item details options, the ‘Open format code generator’ button has been
  replaced with a ‘Tools’ menu providing access both to title formatting help
  and the existing `$set_format()` code snippet generator.
  [[#1550](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1550)]

- In light mode, the border around selected items in themed list views on
  Windows 11 22H2 and newer was removed.
  [[#1545](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1545)]

- In Preferences, items in the playlist view columns list, the playlist view
  groups list and the Filter panel field list can now be reordered using drag
  and drop and by using Ctrl+Shift in combination with the Up, Down, PgUp, PgDn,
  Home and End keys. [[#1535](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1535),
  [#1538](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1538),
  [#1543](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1543)]

- Items in the buttons list in Buttons options can now be reordered using
  Ctrl+Shift in combination with the Up, Down, PgUp, PgDn, Home and End keys.
  [[#1543](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1543)]

- Items in the field list in Item properties options can now be reordered using
  drag and drop and by using Ctrl+Shift in combination with the Up, Down, PgUp,
  PgDn, Home and End keys.
  [[#1551](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1551)]

- Double-clicking in the field list in Item properties options now activates
  inline editing. [[#1551](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1551)]

- In live layout editing context menu, the ‘Add sibling’ submenu was replaced
  with ‘Add before’ and ‘Add after’ submenus.
  [[#1537](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1537)]

- In the context menu for panel captions, the ‘Close panel’ item was removed to
  prevent accidental panel removals.
  [[#1553](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1553)]

### Bug fixes

- A problem where, in dark mode, non-custom focus rectangles in themed list
  views were inset by one pixel was fixed.
  [[#1545](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1545)]

- A bug where list view tooltips were incorrectly sized when a large amount of
  vertical item padding was in use was fixed.
  [[#1552](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1552)]

## 3.2.3

### Bug fixes

- A bug where importing some old FCL files failed with an ‘Unsupported format or
  corrupted file’ error was fixed.
  [[#1526](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1526)]

## 3.2.2

### Features

- Support was added to Item details for loading full track metadata for
  non-playing tracks when using `LargeFieldsConfig-v2.txt` on foobar2000 2.26
  preview 2025-12-28 and newer.
  [[#1521](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1521)]

### Bug fixes

- Some crashes when tracks using the foobar2000 relative path protocol creep
  into a non-portable foobar2000 installation were fixed.
  [[#1520](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1520)]

  Note that such paths do not work in non-portable installations; this change is
  simply to avoid Columns UI-related crashes when such paths are encountered.

## 3.2.1

### Bug fixes

- A bug where `%_display_index%` in style scripts may not have updated correctly
  in playlist views using grouping when items were modified was fixed.
  [[#1514](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1514)]

- Some playlist view grouping logic was made more consistent to avoid a possible
  crash. [[#1514](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1514)]

## 3.2.0

### Features

- If a front cover stub image is configured on the Display preferences page, the
  Artwork view no longer uses it as a fallback for other stub image types.
  [[#1512](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1512)]

  If you were previously relying on that behaviour, you should explicitly
  configure the stub image for all artwork types as needed.

### Bug fixes

- Another Windows bug with DXGI window occlusion statuses, occasionally causing
  the Artwork view and Item details to not update when the display is turned on
  after display output was turned off by Windows, was worked around.
  [[#1510](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1510)]

- Filter search button tooltips are now dark themed when dark mode is enabled.
  [[#1511](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1511)]

## 3.2.0-rc.1

### Features

- An option, ‘Add extra vertical spacing to increase distance between group
  headers and artwork’, was added to the Artwork tab on the Playlist view
  preferences page. [[#1493](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1493)]

  This is enabled by default. When the option is disabled, the additional
  spacing added in 3.2.0-beta.1 before and after a set of group headers in the
  playlist view when artwork is enabled is removed.

### Bug fixes

- A problem where, when ‘Add extra vertical spacing to increase distance between
  group headers and artwork’ is enabled, the additional spacing was missing
  under the first set of group headers in the playlist view was fixed.
  [[#1493](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1493)]

- Right-clicking on a group header in the playlist view and in Item properties
  no longer modifies the existing selection if all items in the group are
  already selected. [[#1496](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1496)]

## 3.2.0-beta.5

### Bug fixes

- A problem where Windows reports inconsistent Direct2D and DXGI window
  occlusion status when the display is turned off, leading to excessive CPU
  usage in Item details, was worked around.
  [[#1491](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1491)]

## 3.2.0-beta.4

### Bug fixes

- A bug introduced in 3.2.0-beta.2 where non-focused selected items in the
  playlist view used the wrong colours was fixed.
  [[#1487](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1487)]

## 3.2.0-beta.3

### Bug fixes

- A bug introduced in 3.2.0-beta.2 where the playlist view did not render
  correctly when scrolled right was fixed.
  [[#1483](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1483)]

- A bug introduced in 3.2.0-beta.2 where `$rgb()` colour codes behaved
  unexpectedly for selected items was fixed.
  [[#1484](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1484)]

## 3.2.0-beta.2

### Features

- An option for playlist view artwork to stay in view when scrolling vertically
  was added. [[#1464](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1464)]

- An option to specify an additional amount of indentation for top-level groups
  in the playlist view was added.
  [[#1473](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1473),
  [#1475](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1475)]

- Rendering performance of some built-in panels was improved in some scenarios.
  [[#1464](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1464),
  [#1466](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1466),
  [#1468](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1468),
  [#1470](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1470),
  [#1475](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1475)]

  Additionally, the behaviour of the spectrum analyser when resizing the panel
  was improved.

- Support for sorting results using the SORT BY operator was added to the Filter
  search toolbar. [[#1474](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1474)]

  Implicit sorting (for example, for time-related queries) is also now enabled
  if ‘Sort tracks added when added to a playlist by:’ is disabled in Filter
  preferences.

### Bug fixes

- A problem where Item details and Artwork view temporarily consumed excessive
  memory if resized when in a hidden tab was fixed.
  [[#1467](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1467)]

  This occurred if Direct2D hardware acceleration was disabled.

- A bug in the playlist view where the drag-and-drop insertion marker did not
  render in the correct place when scrolled right was fixed.
  [[#1464](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1464)]

- The settings on the Artwork tab on the Playlist view preferences page are now
  written to FCL files.
  [[#1464](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1464)]

- A problem where a message about an 0x88982F41 WIC error was logged to the
  console when loading artwork was fixed.
  [[#1472](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1472)]

  This was seen on Windows 7.

- A bug introduced in version 3.2.0-beta.1 where the playlist view style script
  field `%_display_index%` was not updated correctly after removing an item was
  fixed. [[#1475](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1475)]

  This occurred only if grouping was enabled.

### API removals

- Support for the legacy `uie::visualisation` service interface was removed from
  the spectrum analyser visualisation.
  [[#1470](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1470)]

## 3.2.0-beta.1

### Features

#### All built-in list views

- Jumping to items by typing in built-in list views (such as the playlist view)
  now ignores diacritics.
  [[#1428](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1428),
  [#1450](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1450)]

  There may be other changes in behaviour due to a change in the string
  comparison function and options being used for the comparison.

- Built-in list view drag-and-drop overlay images have been replaced with custom
  versions on Windows 10 and newer.
  [[#1447](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1447)]

  This avoids the opaque white background seen on Windows 11 when drag-and-drop
  operations are initiated from built-in Columns UI list views.

  (Note that the white background will still be present when the drag-and-drop
  operation is started from File Explorer.)

#### Playlist view

- The playlist view now hides group headers when they have an empty string as
  their text content. [[#1431](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1431),
  [#1437](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1437),
  [#1439](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1439)]

  Grouping will otherwise behave as though the hidden grouping level exists.

  A zero-width space (`$char(8203)`) can be used in a group title formatting
  script to force the header to be shown when the script evaluates to an empty
  string.

- Playlist view group spacing has been adjusted.
  [[#1440](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1440),
  [#1446](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1446)]

  In particular, spacing around artwork has been adjusted.

  The default indentation step was also reduced from three spaces to two spaces.

- The default playlist view artwork width was increased.
  [[#1443](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1443)]

- The playlist view no longer reloads artwork when custom title-formatting
  fields provided by other components change.
  [[#1444](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1444)]

#### Artwork

- The Artwork and playlist views now automatically rotate and/or mirror artwork
  according to orientation information in embedded image metadata.
  [[#1425](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1425),
  [#1426](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1426)]

#### Filter search

- A hidden menu item, ‘View/Focus Filter search’, for focusing the Filter search
  toolbar was added. [[#1427](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1427)]

  This can be assigned to a keyboard shortcut.

- When there are no Filter panels in the layout, clearing the Filter search
  toolbar now returns no items (similar to the behaviour in Columns UI 2.1.0)
  rather than the entire media library.
  [[#1451](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1451)]

  Pressing the Enter key after clearing the query now returns all items in the
  media library. The special `ALL` query can also be used to return all items.

#### Other changes

- Main menu items for changing the light or dark mode setting were added to the
  View menu. [[#1448](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1448)]

  This includes a hidden menu item that switches to the mode that’s not active,
  intended for use as a keyboard shortcut or as a button.

- A hidden main menu item for toggling main window transparency was added to the
  View menu. [[#1448](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1448)]

- Double-clicking or pressing the Enter key in Item properties now activates
  inline editing. [[#1452](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1452)]

- Inline editing can now be used to edit playlist view column names in the
  column list in Preferences.
  [[#1453](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1453)]

### Bug fixes

- Padding to the right of separators in the Buttons toolbar was reduced at lower
  system display scale (DPI) settings in light mode.
  [[#1435](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1435)]

- The minimum width of Buttons toolbars is now recalculated when switching
  between light and dark mode due to slight differences in separator spacing.
  [[#1435](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1435)]

- When a query has been entered in the Filter search toolbar and there are no
  Filter panels in the layout, removing the toolbar from the layout or switching
  layout preset no longer sends the entire media library to the Filter results
  playlist. [[#1449](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1449)]

## 3.1.5

### Bug fixes

- A bug where Item details sometimes did not update in some scenarios, such as
  the display being in sleep mode, was fixed.
  [[#1413](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1413)]

## 3.1.4

### Bug fixes

- A bug where the Artwork view sometimes did not update in some scenarios, such
  as the display being in sleep mode, was fixed.
  [[#1408](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1408)]

## 3.1.3

### Bug fixes

- The Artwork view and playlist view now ignore CMYK colour profiles that have
  been incorrectly embedded in RGB images.
  [[#1405](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1405)]

## 3.1.2

### Bug fixes

- Artwork colour management now correctly handles display ICC profiles
  containing an embedded
  [Microsoft CDMP profile](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/wcs/wcs-color-device-model-profile-schema-and-algorithms).
  [[#1392](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1392),
  [#1394](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1394),
  [#1395](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1395)]

  Additionally, standalone CDMP display profiles are now ignored, as this
  appears to be in line with the Windows 11 Photos app.

## 3.1.1

### Bug fixes

- A problem where some non-RGB images (such as CMYK images) did not render
  correctly in the Artwork view and playlist view was fixed.
  [[#1383](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1383)]

## 3.1.0

### Features

- The ‘Use alternative emoji font selection logic’ text rendering option was
  updated to the final Unicode 17.0.0 emoji list.
  [[#1376](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1376)]

### Bug fixes

- Playlist view artwork now properly recovers from a graphics card reset when
  Direct2D hardware acceleration is enabled.
  [[#1374](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1374)]

- Missing support for Ctrl+Backspace, and Ctrl+A on older versions of Windows,
  was added to Filter search and two edit controls in Preferences where support
  was missing. [[#1372](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1372)]

- Some Output device and Output format toolbar clean-up code was prevented from
  running on certain types of abnormal process exits, reducing crash log noise
  in rare cases. [[#1373](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1373)]

- A possible problem where some error messages from a library used by Columns UI
  may have been logged to the console in an incorrect text encoding was fixed.
  [[#1375](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1375)]

- A minor bug where the PgUp and PgDn keys did not do anything in the playlist
  view, Filter panel and Item properties for very small panel heights was fixed.
  [[#1377](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1377)]

- The colour of the ‘Columns UI documentation site’ hyperlink on the Setup tab
  in Preferences was corrected on Windows 7.
  [[#1378](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1378)]

## 3.1.0-beta.1

### Features

- The spectrum analyser now ignores invalid visualisation data caused by certain
  third-party components interfering with the visualisation API.
  [[#1358](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1358)]

  (Previous 3.1.0 versions triggered a bug check crash.)

- A link to the Columns UI documentation site was added to the Setup tab in
  preferences. [[#1363](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1363),
  [#1366](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1366)]

  Additionally, all links to the archived Columns UI wiki were replaced with
  links to the current documentation site.

- On the Columns tab on the Playlist view preferences page, ‘Size weight’ was
  renamed ‘Auto-size weight’ and some hint text was added under the playlist
  filters edit box when playlist filters are enabled for that column.
  [[#1363](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1363)]

### Bug fixes

- A bug where sorting the playlist view by a column containing colour codes did
  not work as expected on foobar2000 2.0 and newer was fixed.
  [[#1365](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1365)]

- The Artwork view now always reloads artwork if the track it’s currently
  showing artwork for is modified.
  [[#1364](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1364)]

- The playlist view now reloads the artwork for a group if the first track in
  the group is modified.
  [[#1364](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1364)]

## 3.1.0-alpha.3

### Bug fixes

- A crash after switching playlist while playlist view artwork was loading was
  fixed. [[#1353](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1353)]

## 3.1.0-alpha.2

### Bug fixes

- A crash when a playlist view was destroyed (for example, when closing
  foobar2000) while artwork was loading was fixed.
  [[#1349](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1349)]

## 3.1.0-alpha.1

### Features

#### Artwork view

- The Artwork view now supports colour management. This improves support for
  images with an embedded colour profile and makes image colours more consistent
  with web browsers. [[#1275](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1275),
  [#1284](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1284),
  [#1289](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1289),
  [#1290](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1290),
  [#1292](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1292),
  [#1296](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1296),
  [#1300](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1300),
  [#1301](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1301),
  [#1340](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1340)]

  Additionally, support for Windows Advanced Colour can be enabled in
  Preferences on Windows 10 version 1809 and newer. This improves support for
  HDR and high bit-depth images but is recommended only if HDR is enabled in
  Windows.

  [Further information on colour management in the Artwork view.](https://columns-ui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/other/artwork.html#colour-management)

- The Artwork view now has a ‘Show in File Explorer’ context menu item and click
  action that shows the file containing the displayed image in File Explorer.
  [[#1307](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1307)]

- A ‘Copy path’ command was added to the Artwork view context menu.
  [[#1313](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1313),
  [#1314](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1314)]

- When right-clicking in the Artwork view, a dedicated context menu is now shown
  (rather than the parent container’s context menu with Artwork view items
  appended). [[#1312](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1312)]

#### Playlist view

- The playlist view now supports colour management for artwork images. This
  improves support for images with an embedded colour profile and makes image
  colours more consistent with web browsers.
  [[#1286](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1286)]

  [Further information on colour management in the playlist view.](https://columns-ui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/other/artwork.html#colour-management)

- Direct2D is now used to scale artwork and create artwork reflections in the
  playlist view. [[#1281](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1281),
  [#1289](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1289),

  [#1344](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1344),
  [#1345](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1345)]

#### Buttons toolbar

- The buttons toolbar now supports enabled and pressed states for main menu
  commands that report their command state via the latest foobar2000 API.
  [[#1297](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1297)]

  This requires main menu commands to implement the `mainmenu_commands_v3`
  service interface in the foobar2000 SDK.

#### Layout editing

- The ‘Splitters’ panel category was renamed ‘Containers’.
  [[#1337](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1337)]

- The context menus for live editing and the layout tree in Preferences were
  reorganised. [[#1311](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1311),
  [#1325](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1325)]

  This includes changes to the labels and position of some menu items, adding
  separators and indicating the current container type in the renamed ‘Container
  type’ submenu.

- Commands for moving a panel to the previous or next position in its parent
  container were added to the live editing context menu.
  [[#1325](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1325),
  [#1331](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1331)]

- A ‘Cut’ command was added to the context menus for live editing and the layout
  tree in Preferences. [[#1302](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1302),
  [#1332](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1332)]

- A ‘Paste/Before’ command was added to the live editing context menu.
  [[#1336](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1336)]

- An ‘Edit parent’ command was added to the live editing context menu.
  [[#1336](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1336)]

  This closes the menu for the current panel and shows the live editing menu for
  the parent container.

- The ‘Add sibling’ (previously ‘Add panel’ underneath the name of the parent
  container) command in the live editing context menu now adds the new panel
  directly after the panel the menu is being shown for.
  [[#1336](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1336)]

- Commands to cut, copy or paste panels now all operate on an internal clipboard
  in addition to the Windows clipboard, to protect against accidentally
  overwriting the Windows clipboard with something else before a panel is
  pasted. [[#1332](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1332)]

- Removing the root panel is now allowed, and the previous ‘Change base’ command
  has been removed. [[#1333](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1333)]

- Unknown panels (such as uninstalled panels) are now preserved when copied and
  pasted in the Layout tree in Preferences.
  [[#1302](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1302)]

- ‘Horizontal splitter’ and ‘Vertical splitter’ were renamed ‘Row’ and ‘Column’
  respectively. [[#1337](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1337)]

- Captions are no longer enabled by default when adding panels to row and column
  containers. [[#1341](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1341)]

#### Other

- The Main preferences tab was split into a Setup tab and a Main window tab.
  [[#1309](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1309)]

- The use of hardware acceleration for built-in panels that use Direct2D can now
  be turned off or on in Preferences.
  [[#1309](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1309),
  [#1317](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1317)]

  Hardware acceleration is now disabled by default due to inconsistent
  performance for different hardware.

### Bug fixes

- The built-in spectrum analyser visualisation now uses a more conventional
  frequency scale, with the scale standardised for all playback sample rates.
  [[#1276](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1276),
  [#1338](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1338)]

  This applies only when the horizontal axis is set to use a logarithmic scale.

- A bug where the status bar did not show the selected track count correctly
  when the digit grouping symbol configured in Windows is a non-breaking space
  was fixed. [[#1327](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1327)]

- A bug where artwork images in the playlist view varied in width by up to two
  pixels was fixed. [[#1281](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1281)]

- A bug where the focus was not restored to the previously focused child window
  after some operations, like a ReplayGain scan, was fixed.
  [[#1293](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1293)]

- A possible problem where artwork stopped loading in the Artwork view until
  foobar2000 was restarted was fixed.
  [[#1304](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1304)]

- The Artwork view now correctly updates the shown image after toggling ‘Lock
  artwork type’ straight away.
  [[#1312](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1312)]

- Various bugs relating to the manipulation of single-instance panels during
  live editing were fixed.
  [[#1315](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1315),
  [#1323](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1323),
  [#1324](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1324)]

- Removing the active tab in a Tab stack during live editing now switches to
  another tab (rather than leaving no tab active).
  [[#1315](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1315)]

- A bug where using the ‘Paste (insert)’ (now named ‘Paste/After’) live editing
  command in a Tab stack inserted the panel in the wrong position until
  foobar2000 was restarted was fixed.
  [[#1325](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1325)]

- Copying panels from a Tab stack and pasting them in a row or column container
  no longer results in the panel having a zero width or height.
  [[#1341](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1341)]

- The symbol used for the active layout preset in the View/Layout menu was
  corrected to be a filled circle rather than a tick.
  [[#1326](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1326)]

### Removals

- The option to have a linear vertical scale in the spectrum analyser was
  removed. [[#1338](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1338)]

  This is because it had little purpose.

### Internal changes

- Some code was refactored.
  [[#1268](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1268),
  [#1269](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1269),
  [#1278](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1278),
  [#1306](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1306)]

## 3.0.1

### Bug fixes

- A crash that occurred when closing the Artwork view or foobar2000 while the
  Artwork view was reading artwork was fixed.
  [[#1264](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1264)]

## 3.0.0

- There were no changes from version 3.0.0-rc.1.

## 3.0.0-rc.1

### Features

- The ‘Force greyscale anti-aliasing’ text rendering option was renamed ‘Use
  greyscale anti-aliasing’ and now uses the DirectWrite explicit greyscale
  anti-aliasing mode (instead of using ClearType in greyscale mode).
  [[#1255](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1255)]

### Bug fixes

- A problem where DirectWrite-specific changes made in the Windows ClearType
  Text Tuner did not immediately take effect after clicking the final ‘Finish’
  button was fixed. [[#1248](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1248)]

### Internal changes

- Thread descriptions were set for some worker threads on Windows 10 and newer
  for debugging purposes.
  [[#1248](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1248)]

## 3.0.0-beta.5

### Features

- The performance of the playlist view was improved when reordering items.
  [[#1239](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1239),
  [#1241](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1241)]

  This mainly applies to playlists that do not use grouping.

- A workaround was added to ensure a playlist view is focused when foobar2000
  starts if a misbehaving panel steals the keyboard focus on creation.
  [[#1240](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1240)]

  A warning is logged in the console if this happens.

## 3.0.0-beta.4

### Features

- Support for starting foobar2000 immediately hidden (without the main window
  briefly appearing) when using `foobar2000 /hide` was added on foobar2000 2.1
  and newer. [[#1228](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1228)]

  Additionally, in all versions of foobar2000, when foobar2000 is started
  minimised to the system tray due to it being last closed in that state, the
  main window is no longer briefly activated.

  (Note that other third-party components can still affect the behaviour.)

### Bug fixes

- A crash that may have occurred in the Artwork view after there was an
  unexpected error reading artwork was fixed.
  [[#1237](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1237)]

- A bug where the previously displayed image remained in the Artwork view when
  an image failed to decode was fixed.
  [[#1232](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1232)]

  If an image fails to decode, the panel will now be blank. Decoding errors are
  logged in the console.

- The maximum item width calculation when double-clicking on column header
  dividers for built-in list views (with auto-sizing columns disabled) was
  updated to use DirectWrite for calculating text width.
  [[#1236](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1236)]

### Internal changes

- Various dependencies were updated.
  [[#1227](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1227),
  [#1229](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1229)]

- The
  [`/utf-8` compiler option](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/cpp/build/reference/utf-8-set-source-and-executable-character-sets-to-utf-8?view=msvc-170)
  is now used instead of `/source-charset:utf-8`.

## 3.0.0-beta.3

### Features

- The rendering performance of built-in list views, including the playlist view,
  was improved. [[#1214](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1214)]

- The Artwork view now decodes images in a background thread and renders and
  resizes images using Direct2D.
  [[#1221](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1221)]

  These changes are intended to improve UI responsiveness when loading large
  images and images that are otherwise slow to decode.

### Bug fixes

- A regression in version 2.0.0 that stopped double-clicking in empty space in
  the Playlist tabs from creating a new playlist was fixed.
  [[#1210](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1210)]

- A problem where the state of the ‘Hide when a single playlist is open’
  Playlist tabs option in Preferences was reversed was fixed.
  [[#1211](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1211)]

- If the Playlist tabs ‘Hide when a single playlist is open’ option is turned
  on, a Playlist tabs panel without a child panel now has a maximum height of 0
  when there is only one playlist.
  [[#1211](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1211)]

- Some minor improvements of how DirectWrite per-monitor rendering parameters
  are handled were made.
  [[#1212](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1212)]

## 3.0.0-beta.2

### Bug fixes

- The component is once again compiled with Visual Studio 2022 17.13 due to a
  suspected code generation bug in version 17.14 causing the 32-bit build of
  Columns UI to crash.

## 3.0.0-beta.1

### Features

- The colours of the default dark mode playback button icons were adjusted
  slightly. [[#1201](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1201),
  [#1203](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1203)]

### Bug fixes

- DirectWrite-rendered text now automatically uses greyscale anti-aliasing if
  ClearType (but not font smoothing) is disabled globally in Windows.
  [[#1202](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1202)]

- A workaround for playlist and other list view column titles not rendering on
  Wine was added. [[#1185](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1185)]

- A problem where the playlist view column titles could become incorrectly
  positioned in some scenarios was fixed.
  [[#1194](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1194)]

- A problem where the playlist view vertical scroll position was reset in some
  cases after showing and hiding columns was fixed.
  [[#1194](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1194)]

### Internal changes

- An updated font API for panels was implemented for release 8.0.0-beta.1 of the
  Columns UI SDK. [[#1179](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1179),
  [#1183](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1183),
  [#1192](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1192),
  [#1195](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1195)]

- The component is now compiled with Visual Studio 2022 17.14.

## 3.0.0-alpha.6

### Features

- Item details now uses Direct2D for rendering.
  [[#1120](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1120),
  [#1153](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1153),
  [#1158](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1158)]

  This includes support for SVG font glyphs on recent versions of Windows,
  including Windows 11 emojis.

- An option to control whether colour glyphs are used for DirectWrite-rendered
  text was added to the Text rendering tab on the Colours and fonts preferences
  page. [[#1159](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1159)]

  This applies to Windows 8.1 and newer only.

- An opt-in experimental alternative emoji font selection mode for Windows 8.1
  and newer was added. [[#1126](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1126),
  [#1167](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1167)]

  This replaces the default DirectWrite emoji font selection logic to:
  - enable correct handling of emoji variation selectors for emojis that have
    both text (monochrome) and emoji presentation modes
  - use the default presentation mode of emojis as defined in the Unicode
    specification
  - allow custom colour and monochrome emoji fonts to be used

### Bug fixes

- A bug where some message boxes sometimes had an incorrect height was fixed.
  [[#1157](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1157)]

- A bug where automatically-inserted ellipses did not use the correct colour for
  DirectWrite-rendered text was fixed.
  [[#1157](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1157)]

- A bug where left and/or top padding was missing in Item details when there was
  no horizontal or vertical scroll bar was fixed.
  [[#1120](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1120)]

- A bug where the system tray icon did not always have the correct tooltip text
  immediately after minimising the main window when ‘Always show icon’ is turned
  off and ‘Minimise to icon’ is turned on was fixed.
  [[#1151](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1151)]

- A bug where the `%default_font_size%` and the deprecated `%default_font_face%`
  title formatting fields did not update in Item details after a font change
  until another event caused a content update was fixed.
  [[#1120](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1120)]

- A bug where the font family and font style drop-down controls on the Fonts
  preferences tab did not have the expected appearance on foobar2000 1.x when
  dark mode is enabled was fixed.
  [[#1129](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1129)]

- A potential fix was added for a crash when exiting foobar2000 after recently
  interacting with an auto-hiding splitter.
  [[#1131](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1131)]

### Internal changes

- The component is now compiled using foobar2000 SDK 2025-03-07.
  [[#1164](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1164)]

- The component is now compiled with Visual Studio 2022 17.13.

## 3.0.0-alpha.5

### Features

- A ‘GDI-compatible, no anti-aliasing’ DirectWrite text rendering mode was
  added. [[#1102](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1102),
  [#1103](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1103),
  [#1104](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1104),
  [#1113](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1113)]

  Additionally, the previous ‘Automatic’ mode has been renamed ‘Automatic
  anti-aliasing’, and a new ‘Default’ mode has been added that selects
  ‘Automatic anti-aliasing’ or ‘GDI-compatible, no anti-aliasing’ based on the
  system ‘Smooth edges of screen fonts’ setting.

### Bug fixes

- A problem where DirectWrite did not render trailing whitespace for centre- and
  right-aligned columns was worked around in list views (playlist view, playlist
  switcher, Filter panel), and the status bar and pane.
  [[#1112](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1112)]

  This workaround does not apply to the Item details panel. To work around it in
  Item details, end the affected line with a zero-width space (`$char(8203)`).

- A bug was fixed where foobar2000 incorrectly appeared in the taskbar after
  running `foobar2000.exe /hide` or invoking the View/Hide main menu command
  when foobar2000 was minimised to the system tray.
  [[#1110](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1110)]

- A bug where the keyboard focus changed after minimising and restoring
  foobar2000 was fixed.
  [[#1109](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1109)]

- Some logic that normally occurs when main window is activated or focused was
  surpressed while foobar2000 is exiting, as that logic is unnecessary at that
  point. [[#1109](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1109)]

- An error message is now shown when trying to use Columns UI on Windows 7 SP1
  without installing the Platform Update for Windows 7.
  [[#1115](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1115)]

  (Previously, this resulted in a crash.)

- A crash following a failure to list available fonts on the Fonts preferences
  page was fixed. [[#1116](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1116)]

- Fonts in use are now refreshed whenever a font is installed or uninstalled in
  Windows, allowing better recovery if a font in use is deleted or replaced.
  [[#1117](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1117)]

- A problem where some panels were notified of font changes multiple times when
  the text rendering mode is changed, or after importing an FCL file, was fixed.
  [[#1105](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1105)]

  This applied to the `ui_config_callback::ui_fonts_changed()` callback.

## 3.0.0-alpha.4

- A bug where DirectWrite-rendered text did not use the correct font family on
  Windows 10 and older versions of Windows 11 was fixed.
  [[#1099](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1099)]

- A bug where typing axis values in the dialogue box opened by the ‘Configure
  variable font axes...’ button on the Fonts preferences tab did not work was
  fixed. [[#1094](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1094)]

- Truncated labels at low system display scale (DPI) setting values in the
  dialogue box opened by the ‘Configure variable font axes...’ button on the
  Fonts preferences tab were corrected.
  [[#1094](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1094)]

- A Windows bug causing a crash on Windows 8.1 when opening the Fonts tab on the
  Colours and fonts preferences page was worked around.
  [[#1098](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1098)]

## 3.0.0-alpha.3

### Bug fixes

- A bug where it wasn’t possible to add new buttons or change existing button
  commands in the Buttons toolbar was fixed.
  [[#1087](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1087)]

## 3.0.0-alpha.2

### Bug fixes

- The ability to use the tab character in playlist group titles to lay out text
  in columns was restored.
  [[#1080](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1080)]

- A bug causing incorrect characters to appear in the the Item details format
  code generator dialogue box title was fixed.
  [[#1076](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1076)]

- Some stylistic inconsistencies in dialogue box titles were fixed.
  [[#1082](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1082)]

- A nicer error message is now logged to the console when using $set_font() with
  a non-existent font family name.
  [[#1081](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1081)]

## 3.0.0-alpha.1

### Features

- Text in list views (such as the playlist view, playlist switcher, Filter panel
  and Item properties), Item details and in the status bar and pane is now
  rendered using DirectWrite.
  [[#897](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/897),

  This includes colour font support on Windows 8.1 and newer (allowing the use
  of, for example, colour emojis).

  Tabular figures (numerals) are now also used for supported fonts that default
  to proportional figures (such as some Segoe UI variants).

  Customisation of variable font (such as Segoe UI Variable) axes of variation
  is supported on Windows 11 23H2 and newer.

  Some customisation of DirectWrite text rendering is available on the new Text
  rendering tab on the Colours and fonts preferences page.

  Note that there may be slight differences in line heights for these panels
  compared to previous versions, depending on the font, font size and system
  display scale (DPI setting).

- A new DirectWrite-based font picker was added to the Colours and fonts
  preferences page. [[#916](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/916),
  [#919](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/919),

  [#1060](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1060),
  [#1064](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1064)]

  This features better grouping of font families and now allows the entry of
  non-integer font sizes (to one decimal place).

  Note that some font styles will revert to the closest supported GDI equivalent
  when used with a panel that doesn’t use DirectWrite and the latest Columns UI
  API.

  Some legacy font types that aren’t supported by DirectWrite are also no longer
  selectable. Furthermore, some previously hidden fonts may now be visible.

- New `$set_format()` and `$reset_format()` title formatting functions were
  added to Item details.
  [[#1004](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1004),
  [#1011](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1011),

  [#1023](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1023),
  [#1062](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1062)]

  These serve as replacements for the older `$set_font()` and `$reset_font()`
  functions.

  [Documentation for `$set_format()` and `$reset_format()`.](https://columns-ui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/item-details/title-formatting.html)

- The `$set_font()` Item details title formatting function now allows
  non-integer font sizes to be specified.
  [[#947](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/947)]

- Message boxes now have a consistent appearance, and are dark themed when dark
  mode is active. [[#1041](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1041),
  [#1043](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1043)]

  switch to the next and previous tab respectively.
  [[#817](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/817)]

- An option to make clicking on the Artwork view panel open the displayed image
  in the foobar2000 picture viewer was added on foobar2000 1.6.2 or newer.
  [[#853](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/853)]

  This is now the default for new installations.

- A command was added to the Artwork view context menu to open the displayed
  image in the foobar2000 picture viewer on foobar2000 1.6.2 or newer.
  [[#849](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/849)]

- Clearing the Filter search toolbar now returns all items in the media library
  if there are no Filter panels in the layout.
  [[#857](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/857)]

  This makes the behaviour consistent with what happens when there are Filter
  panels in the layout.

- When using inline editing on multiple tracks in the playlist view and Item
  properties, existing values are now included in the edit box after the text
  `«mixed values»` when the current values of the field differ between the
  tracks. [[#871](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/871)]

- The way metadata changes are saved in Item properties and Filter panel was
  improved. [[#863](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/863)]

- Deleting layout presets in preferences is now a two-step process to avoid
  accidental deletions. [[#891](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/891)]

  (The confirmation dialogue box can be bypassed by holding down Shift while
  clicking the button.)

- Deleting the last layout preset is now prevented instead of reseting layout
  presets to the default preset.
  [[#1053](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1053)]

- References to ‘notification area’ were changed to ‘system tray’ to align with
  the current Windows terminology.
  [[#1035](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1035)]

- Some diagnostic logging to the foobar2000 console was added when unexpected
  errors occur. [[#916](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/916)]

  the panels was eliminated.
  [[#1033](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1033)]

  first focusable element in the new tab.
  [[#817](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/817)]

- A Windows bug causing visual glitches after running a full-screen game with
  certain monitor configurations was worked around.

  [[#847](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/847)]

- A bug in the Buttons toolbar where item group ‘None’ caused the context menu
  command not to be executed was fixed.
  [[#889](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/889)]

  Note: An item group of ‘None’ is used to execute a context menu command
  without any tracks, which isn’t normally useful.

- Item details now updates when it’s tracking the current selection and a
  component indicates a custom title formatting field has changed.
  [[#912](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/912)]

- The Item details options dialogue box now respects the current dark mode
  setting when opened from the Layout preferences page.
  [[#909](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/909)]

- Item properties now updates when a component indicates a custom title
  formatting field has changed.
  [[#912](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/912)]

  (Although Item properties doesn’t use title formatting, this change makes the
  panel update when things like playback statistics change.)

- The vertical item padding in Item properties and some list views in
  preferences now scales with the system display scale (DPI setting).
  [[#925](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/925)]

- A bug where the status bar may crash when using a very small font size was
  fixed. [[#935](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/935)]

- A bug where dynamic internet radio artwork may not have been immediately shown
  after changing the ‘Displayed track’ in the Artwork view panel was fixed.
  [[#854](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/854)]

- A bug where the playlist view did not always re-render correctly when toggling
  the ‘Show column titles’ option was fixed.
  [[#983](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/983)]

- Command-line help was updated to include previously undocumented export
  commands. [[#1048](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/1048)]

- The tab order of controls on the Grouping tab on the playlist view preferences
  page was corrected. [[#781](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/781)]

  [[#799](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/799)]

- The component is now compiled with Visual Studio 2022 17.7.

## 2.1.0-beta.3

### Bug fixes

- Performance regressions in the playlist view during operations such as sorting
  were fixed. [[#776](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/776)]

## 2.1.0-beta.2

### Features

- Indentation of grouping levels in the playlist view was made configurable.
  [[#774](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/774)]

  The default configuration matches the behaviour of Columns UI 2.0.0.

## 2.1.0-beta.1

### Features

- A playlist selector toolbar was added.
  [[#729](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/729)]

- Grouping in the built-in playlist view was updated
  [[#770](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/770)]:
  - each grouping level is no longer indented
  - padding either side of artwork was reduced
  - artwork reflection is now disabled by default

- The built-in playlist view now remembers vertical scroll positions of
  playlists after closing and reopening foobar2000, on foobar2000 2.0 and newer.
  [[#742](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/742),
  [#743](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/743)]

- If the focused item in a non-active playlist changes, the built-in playlist
  view now scrolls to that focused item when the playlist is next activated.
  [[#746](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/746)]

- In the playlist switcher and playlist tabs, when adding items to a playlist
  using drag and drop, the first new item added to the playlist is now focused.
  [[#746](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/746)]

- The behaviour of Ctrl+Backspace and Ctrl+A was made consistent across edit
  controls that are part of Columns UI itself.
  [[#735](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/735),
  [#740](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/740)]

- A built-in icon for the stop after current command was added to the Buttons
  toolbar. [[#757](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/757),
  [#762](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/762)]

- When title formatting is used in the playlist switcher panel, typing in the
  panel now always searches by the actual playlist name and not the displayed
  title. [[#738](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/738)]

  foobar2000 2.0 and newer, as full metadata is always available on these
  versions. [[#734](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/734)]

- Dark menus were enabled on Windows 11 build 22631.
  [[#771](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/771)]

### Bug fixes

  enabled, the configured colour is now correctly shown on the preferences page
  and used for the focused item frame in supported panels.
  [[#754](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/754)]

  Previously, changing the colour had no effect on the actual colour used or
  shown in preferences. If you were using the themed or system colour schemes
  and had ‘Use custom active item frame’ enabled, the colour of the focused item
  frame may change after upgrading due to the saved custom colour now correctly
  being used.

- List views no longer use a dotted active (focused) item frame by default in
  dark mode when the themed scheme is active.
  [[#755](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/755)]

- Inline editing in list views now always saves and exits when clicking outside
  the edit box. [[#769](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/769)]

  around. [[#766](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/766)]

- Tooltips in the buttons toolbar, seekbar and volume bar are now dark themed
  when dark mode is active.
  [[#760](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/760),
  [#764](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/764)]

- If the system DPI setting changes between foobar2000 sessions, the main window
  size is now adjusted accordingly when foobar2000 starts.
  [[#732](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/732)]

- Live editing no longer misbehaves when right-clicking on scroll bars.
  [[#741](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/741)]

- Visual glitches when toggling the Show toolbars option were fixed.
  [[#750](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/750)]

- In the playlist tabs and tab stack panels, a small rendering glitch below the
  left and right scroll buttons when scrolling left and right with dark mode
  enabled was fixed. [[#737](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/737)]

  playlist switcher, status bar and status pane on foobar2000 2.0.
  [[#721](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/721)]

- In the playlist tabs and tab stack panels, the hover item now rerenders
  correctly after using the mouse wheel.
  [[#723](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/723)]

- Some buttons toolbar console messages were updated to refer to hover icons
  instead of hot images. [[#708](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/708)]

### Internal changes

- The component is now compiled using foobar2000 SDK 2023-04-18.
  [[#699](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/699)]

  components are used was fixed.
  [[#684](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/684)]

- The title bar of a maximised main window now correctly updates when switching
  between light and dark mode on Windows 10.
  [[#696](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/696)]

### Internal changes

## 2.0.0-beta.1

### Features

- Support for static [SVG files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG) was added to
  the Buttons toolbar. [[#628](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/628),
  [#643](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/643)]

  This requires the [SVG services component](https://yuo.be/svg-services).

- Built-in icons in non-standard sizes are now rendered using an
  [SVG image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG) when the
  [SVG services component](https://yuo.be/svg-services) is installed.
  [[#650](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/650)]

  This improves quality for icons displayed in sizes where a pre-rendered
  version in that size isn’t bundled in Columns UI.

## 2.0.0-alpha.5

### Features

- A further improvement was made to the performance of the Filter panel when
  handling dynamic media library changes.
  [[#615](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/615)]

## 2.0.0-alpha.4

### Features

- The performance of the Filter panel when handling dynamic media library
  changes was improved. [[#609](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/609),
  [#611](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/611)]

  This includes reducing Filter panel initialisation time in foobar2000 2.0
  during foobar2000 start-up.

- The Filter panel no longer reports initialisation times in foobar2000 2.0 when
  it loads before the media library has initialised.
  [[#612](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/612)]

### Bug fixes

- A crash, when clicking Move down on the Grouping tab in playlist view
  preferences without a group selected, was fixed.
  [[#613](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/613)]

- Flickering when switching tabs in the Tab stack panel was reduced.
  [[#610](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/610)]

## 2.0.0-alpha.3

### Bug fixes

- A crash in 64-bit builds after adding a Tab stack to the layout was fixed.
  [[#606](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/606)]

- A problem in the Quick setup dialogue box where selecting a layout preset had
  no effect was fixed. [[#607](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/607)]

## 2.0.0-alpha.2

### Features

- A 64-bit build (for x64 processors) was added for 64-bit versions of
  foobar2000 2.0 and newer.
  [[#568](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/568)]

- Performance under foobar2000 2.0 was improved.
  [[#585](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/585),
  [#587](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/587),
  [#588](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/588),
  [#591](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/591)]

- Various built-in pop-up foobar2000 windows (e.g. Album List, Search, Playlist
  Manager) now use Columns UI colours and fonts when Columns UI is active.
  [[#574](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/574),
  [#579](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/579),
  [#590](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/590)]

  This requires foobar2000 2.0 or newer.

  For colours, only the text, background and selection background colours can be
  explicitly configured. The equivalent of the Default UI highlight colour
  currently isn’t configurable.

  For fonts, the default, list items and console fonts can be individually
  configured.

  These changes also apply to any third-party components that use new colour and
  font APIs added in foobar2000 2.0

- Dark mode support was added for Columns UI preference pages when using
  foobar2000 2.0. [[#582](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/582),
  [#592](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/592),
  [#595](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/595)]

  Other dialogue boxes will follow in a future release.

- Dark menus were enabled on Windows 11 version 22H2.
  [[#594](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/594), contributed by
  [@marc2k3](https://github.com/marc2k3)]

- An audio track toolbar was added. When a file containing multiple audio tracks
  (e.g. different languages) is playing, this toolbar allows you to select
  between those tracks. [[#573](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/573)]

  It requires foobar2000 2.0 or newer and is equivalent to the ‘Stream Selector’
  toolbar in the Default User Interface.

- The edit box that appears when using inline editing in Columns UI list views
  now has a dark appearance when dark mode is on.
  [[#593](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/593)]

- When mixed size images are used in the buttons toolbar, they are now all
  resized to the same size.
  [[#548](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/548)]

  (Previously, images in the wrong size would display incorrectly or other
  problems would occur.)

  A message is also printed to the console when mixed size custom images are
  detected.

- A custom icon size can now be used in the buttons toolbar.
  [[#552](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/552)]

  If set, custom images will be resized as necessary.

- The buttons toolbar options dialogue box was updated, with some terminology
  changed. [[#552](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/552)]

- Additional sizes of the default playback button icons were added to improve
  their rendering at certain system DPI settings.
  [[#554](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/554)]

- The default stop button icon was tweaked.
  [[#554](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/554)]

- Active tabs in the Tab stack and Playlist tabs panels no longer change colour
  on hover when dark mode is active.
  [[#549](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/549)]

### Bug fixes

- Various problems relating to configuring a custom active item frame colour
  were fixed. [[#581](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/581)]

- A bug where the padding of buttons in the buttons toolbar changed when a
  system notification about a setting change was received was fixed.
  [[#562](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/562)]

- A bug which stopped ICO files from working as custom hot images in the buttons
  toolbar was fixed. [[#547](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/547)]

- A GDI object leak when using ICO files as custom button images was fixed.
  [[#547](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/547)]

- The initial widths of the list view columns in the Buttons and Item properties
  options dialogue boxes were updated to scale with the system DPI setting.
  [[#550](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/550)]

- Rendering glitches in the edit box that appears during inline editing in
  Columns UI list views were fixed.
  [[#593](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/593)]

- A truncated label in the Item properties options dialogue box was corrected.
  [[#550](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/550)]

### Removals

- Exported buttons toolbar configurations (FCB files) aren’t compatible with
  older versions of Columns UI.
  [[#552](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/552)]

- Exported configurations (FCL files) containing a buttons toolbar in the layout
  aren’t compatible with older versions of Columns UI.
  [[#552](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/552)]

### Internal changes

- The component is now compiled with Visual Studio 2022 17.3.

- The component is now compiled using foobar2000 SDK 2022-08-29.
  [[#568](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/568),
  [#575](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/575)]

## 2.0.0-alpha.1

### Features

- Support for the Windows 10 and 11 dark mode was added on Windows 10 version
  2004 and newer.
  [[multiple pull requests](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+label%3A%22dark+mode%22+merged%3A%3C%3D2022-04-21)]

  This can be enabled from the Mode tab on the Colours and fonts preferences
  page.

  Light and dark modes have independent colour settings. However, any custom
  colours that are currently active will be copied to dark mode settings on
  upgrade.

  The default value for a custom colour can be reselected by clicking on the
  Change... button for that colour, and selecting the first colour from the
  'Custom colours:' section of the colour picker dialogue box.

  Dark menus aren’t enabled on Windows 11 builds newer than 22598. This is to
  avoid unexpected problems on untested builds, because the Windows APIs to
  enable dark menus aren’t public.

  Third-party panels that contain system UI elements like scroll bars will need
  updating to fully support dark mode.

  The previous mode setting on the Colours tab of Colours and fonts preferences
  has been renamed scheme to disambiguate it from the new mode setting.

- The shading of alternate rows in the playlist view was disabled by default in
  new installations. [[#522](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/522)]

  It can still be enabled (in new installations) by uncommenting the second line
  in the default global style script.

- Status bar and status pane preferences were fully separated.
  [[#516](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/516)]

- The status bar can now show the number of selected tracks.
  [[#450](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/450), contributed by
  [@m0vie](https://github.com/m0vie)]

- Improvements were made to the status bar layout logic (including better DPI
  scaling). [[#432](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/432)]

- The status bar playlist lock icon was updated.
  [[#432](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/432),
  [#513](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/513)]

- The default playback button icons were tweaked. This includes the removal of
  subtle glow effects. [[#435](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/435),
  [#463](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/463),
  [#474](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/474)]

- The spectrum analyser is now integrated with the Colours and fonts preferences
  page, and its foreground colour and background colour are now configured
  there. [[#466](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/466),
  [#470](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/470),
  [#473](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/473),
  [#514](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/514),
  [#540](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/540)]

- The Filter search toolbar is now integrated with the Colours and fonts
  preferences page, and its font, foreground colour and background colour are
  now configurable. [[#424](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/424),
  [#482](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/482)]

  (Note that selection colours are not supported.)

- The Filter search button icons were updated.
  [[#438](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/438)]

- The default no-cover artwork image was updated.
  [[#437](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/437)]

- The 'View/Show toolbars' menu item is now only shown if the shift key is held
  down when opening the View menu.
  [[#410](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/410)]

- A warning was added under the 'Show toolbars' option in preferences.
  [[#410](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/410)]

### Bug fixes

- A problem where the playlist tabs panel had an incorrect maximum width or
  height was fixed. [[#449](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/449)]

- The hover colour of text in a buttons toolbar in flat mode was corrected so
  that it is typically white in light mode.
  [[#479](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/479)]

  (This change has the side effect of an uglier hover animation on some versions
  of Windows.)

- Flickering when resizing the Playlist tabs and Tab stack panels was
  eliminated. [[#451](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/451)]

- Flickering of panel captions when resizing a panel was eliminated.
  [[#496](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/496)]

- Various glitches with the rendering of toolbar sizing grips were fixed.
  [[#495](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/495),
  [#497](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/497)]

- Various bugs with the positioning and sizing of panel captions were fixed.
  [[#418](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/418)]

- The status bar pop-up volume bar now correctly scales with the system DPI
  setting. [[#418](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/418)]

- The position of seekbar and volume bar tooltips relative to the pointer
  position was corrected so that it's based on the actual pointer size, rather
  than a fixed offset. [[#494](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/494)]

- The item indentation of the layout tree on the Layout preferences page was
  corrected to scale with the system DPI setting.
  [[#517](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/517)]

- Various truncated labels in preferences were corrected.
  [[#469](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/469),
  [#516](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/516)]

### Removals

- Support for foobar2000 1.4 was removed. foobar2000 1.5 is now the minimum
  version required.

### Internal changes

- The component is now compiled using Visual Studio 2022 17.1 and the /std:c++20
  compiler option. [[#408](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/408),
  [#409](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/409)]

- The component is now compiled using foobar2000 SDK 2022-01-04.
  [[#419](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/419)]

- Preliminary work towards 64-bit support was undertaken.
  [[#457](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/457),
  [#467](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/467)]

## 1.7.0

- There were no changes from version 1.7.0-beta.2.

## 1.7.0-beta.2

### Features

- The DSP preset, Output device, Playback order and ReplayGain mode toolbars are
  now integrated with the Colours and fonts preferences page, and their fonts,
  foreground colours and background colours are now configurable.
  [[#390](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/390) (contributed by
  [@rplociennik](https://github.com/rplociennik)),
  [#392](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/392),
  [#397](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/397)]

  (Note that selection colours are not supported.)

- A new Output format toolbar was added, allowing the selection of the output
  bit depth for output devices that don’t use automatic output format selection.
  [[#389](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/389), contributed by
  [@rplociennik](https://github.com/rplociennik)]

- The DSP preset toolbar now displays the text '(no DSP presets exist)' if no
  DSP presets have been created.
  [[#395](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/395)]

### Bug fixes

- The minimum widths of the DSP preset and Output device toolbars now update if
  the list of DSP presets or output devices changes.
  [[#393](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/393)]

  Note that this only happens when the drop-down list in the toolbar is clicked
  on or otherwise expanded, as this is the only time the lists of DSP presets
  and output devices are refreshed.

### Internal changes

- The component is now compiled using Visual Studio 2019 16.11.

## 1.7.0-beta.1

### Features

- Support for dynamic internet radio front cover images was added to the Artwork
  view panel. [[#367](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/367)]

  (Requires foobar2000 1.6.6 or newer.)

- Support for back cover, disc and artist stub images was added to the Artwork
  view panel. [[#345](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/345)]

- In the Artwork view panel, when the artwork type is not locked and the panel
  automatically switches to a different artwork type, it now returns to the
  previously selected artwork type once it’s available again.
  [[#368](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/368),
  [#381](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/381)]

- A 'Reload artwork' command was added to the artwork view context menu. This
  forces a reload of artwork from source using current settings.
  [[#351](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/351),
  [#382](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/382)]

- The list view scrolling speed when selecting items or using drag and drop was
  adjusted to be slower, particularly for short lists such as in Buttons
  options. [[#349](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/349)]

- The Item properties and Item details panels now expand and align tab
  characters. [[#350](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/350)]

- When multiple tracks are selected and some of them have a value for a
  particular metadata field and some do not, the Item properties panel now makes
  this clearer by appending '(not set)' to the list of values for that field.
  [[#370](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/370)]

- The Item properties panel now shows '(blank)' for a metadata field if it’s set
  but the value is an empty string.
  [[#370](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/370)]

- The Filter panel no longer focuses the first playlist item when using any of
  the send to playlist commands or actions. This improves compatibility with
  shuffle playback modes when 'Playback follows cursor' is enabled.
  [[#352](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/352)]

- In the playlist view, group titles now respect the 'Display ellipses in
  truncated text' option.

### Bug fixes

- A bug causing misbehaviour of colour codes or a possible crash after scrolling
  in the Item details panel was fixed.
  [[#372](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/372)]

- A problem in the Buttons toolbar preventing buttons for certain File
  operations context menu commands from working was fixed.
  [[#379](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/379)]

  (Note that any existing such buttons won’t be automatically fixed; the command
  will need to be reselected or the button recreated for the button to work.)

- A problem where panels were queried for configuration data too frequently
  following [#320](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/320) was resolved.
  [[#364](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/364)]

- A problem where GDI+ was used to load stub artwork images in the Artwork view
  panel instead of the Windows Imaging Component (WIC) was fixed
  [[#371](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/371)].

  (See [the change log for version 1.4.0-beta.1](#140-beta1) for more details on
  what this means.)

  [#363](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/363)]

## 1.6.0

### Features

- SSE2 instructions are now enabled (and hence are now required).
  [[#329](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/329)]

- Items details now tries to preserve the scroll position when adjusting
  settings. [[#335](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/335)]

### Bug fixes

- The positioning of lines in Item details when a font change was immediately
  followed by a colour change was corrected.
  [[#338](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/338)]

  Additionally, font changes that don’t affect any text (e.g. due to being
  immediately followed by another font change) now correctly affect the height
  of the line.

- A bug was fixed where it sometimes wasn't possible to scroll to the very
  bottom of Items details when both horizontal and vertical scroll bars were
  visible. [[#335](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/335)]

- Miscalculated bottom padding in the background of some dialogues at high DPIs
  was fixed. [[#334](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/334)]

### Internal changes

- The component is now compiled using foobar2000 SDK 2020-07-28.
  [[#329](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/329)]

## 1.5.0

### Features

- Filter search now allows the use of
  [time-based expressions](https://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=Foobar2000:Query_syntax#Time_expressions).
  [[#300](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/300)]

  Note that these currently don’t update continuously when results change due to
  e.g. the system time advancing.

### Bug fixes

- Custom Album list panel active item frame colours are now included in exported
  FCL files. [[#316](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/316)]

- A crash or other unexpected behaviour when certain emojis were displayed in
  the Item details panel was fixed.
  [[#323](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/323),
  [#324](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/324)]

  Word-wrapping behaviour may be slightly different from earlier versions as a
  result of the fix.

- A bug where a panel copied during live editing may have had stale
  configuration data was fixed.
  [[#320](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/320)]

- The Item properties panel no longer has tab-based alignment and columns
  enabled, due to the confusing behaviour caused when tab characters are
  encountered in metadata.
  [[#319](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/319)]

### Internal changes

- The component is now compiled using Visual Studio 2019 16.6.

## 1.4.1

### Bug fixes

- A regression in the buttons toolbar, which may have caused the loading of
  custom images with relative paths to fail, was fixed.
  [[#298](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/298)]

## 1.4.0

### Bug fixes

- Zero-length artwork images are now ignored. (Previously, an error was logged
  in the console when they were encountered.)
  [[#294](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/294)]

## 1.4.0-rc.1

### Bug fixes

- A problem reading artwork from Windows Media files, and using certain
  third-party input components, was worked around.
  [[#292](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/292)]

## 1.4.0-beta.1

### Removals

- The artwork source settings in Columns UI were removed and now only the
  settings on the main Display preferences page are used.

  If Columns UI artwork source settings were in use, you will be prompted to
  transfer your settings on upgrade.
  [[#286](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/286)]

- The playlist view ‘Low artwork reader thread priority’ setting was removed; a
  low thread priority is now always used.
  [[#270](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/270)]

- The ability to display tooltips for non-truncated text in the playlist view
  was removed. [[#272](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/272)]

### Features

- The Windows Imaging Component is now used to load button images, and artwork
  in the artwork panel and playlist view.

  On recent versions of Windows 10, this adds support for WebP and HEIF images
  if the required codecs are installed. These are usually installed
  automatically, but can also be manually installed from the Microsoft Store:
  - [WebP image extensions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/webp-image-extensions/9pg2dk419drg)
  - [HEIF image extensions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/heif-image-extensions/9pmmsr1cgpwg)

  On older versions of Windows and on Wine,
  [the Google WebP codec](https://storage.googleapis.com/downloads.webmproject.org/releases/webp/WebpCodecSetup.exe)
  can be installed for WebP support.

  Note: Currently, when configuring artwork sources in Display preferences, the
  .webp or .heif file extension must be explicitly specified for WebP or HEIF
  files to be loaded. (Using `.*` for the file extension will not load WebP or
  HEIF files.) [[#276](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/276)]

### Internal changes

- The component is now compiled using foobar2000 SDK 2019-12-27.
  [[#271](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/271),
  [#285](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/285)]

## 1.3.0

- There were no changes from version 1.3.0-rc.1.

## 1.3.0-rc.1

### Features

- When using in-line field editing in the playlist view, empty field values are
  no longer written to the file when saving changes. (If no field values are
  entered, the field is now removed from the file.)
  [[#266](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/266)]

- In-line field editing in the playlist view is no longer sometimes blocked if a
  file with no loaded metadata is encountered.
  [[#266](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/266)]

### Bug fixes

- A crash was fixed when using in-line field editing in the playlist view and
  setting a field to an empty string.
  [[#266](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/266)]

- A crash was fixed when saving changes after using in-line field editing in the
  playlist view on more than two tracks with initially differing field values.
  [[#266](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/266)]

### Internal changes

- The component is now compiled using Visual Studio 2019 16.4.

## 1.3.0-beta.1

### Removals

- Support for foobar2000 1.3 was removed. foobar2000 1.4 is now the minimum
  version required.

### Features

- When using in-line field editing in the playlist view, it’s now possible to
  enter multiple field values by separating values with semicolons.
  [[#263](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/263)]

### Playlist view

- Removed the Columns playlist. On upgrade, any Columns playlist instances in
  layout presets will be replaced with NG playlist (now simply named playlist
  view). [[#103](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/issues/103),
  [#114](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/114)]

- Slightly faster playlist grouping and sorting performance on multi-core PCs.

- Right-clicking in empty space in the playlist view now correctly deselects all
  items and always displays a context menu.
  [[#75](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/issues/75)]

- Added a main menu command to toggle whether playlist groups are shown.
  (Additionally, if the menu item is added as button, the button will become

  by tuxzz, [#56](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/56)]

### Item details panel

- Made the Item details panel load full metadata (including large fields such as
  lyrics) for selected items. (Note: full metadata for playing tracks is
  dependent on the input component.)

- Added a live layout editing button to the default buttons toolbar
  configuration. [[#99](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/99)]

- Fixed a bug in the buttons toolbar where clicking on a context menu item
  button configured to use the 'Active selection' item group, with selection
  viewers set to prefer the playing track, would not have an effect if a track
  was playing. Now, the button will operate on the current selection as
  expected. [[#110](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/110)]

  -20 dB at the 25% mark etc.
  [[#109](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/pull/109)]

### Status pane

- Corrected the status pane playback status when resume playback on start-up is
  enabled and foobar2000 is started when playback was previously paused.

- Corrected the colour of text in the status pane when using high-contrast
  Windows themes. [Contributed by MAxonn,
  [#59](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/issues/59)]

  [[#47](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/issues/47)]

- Added CLI commands for exporting the current configuration to an FCL file. The
  added commands are `/columnsui:export <path>` and
  `/columnsui:export-quiet <path>`.
  [[#47](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/issues/47)]

  other components. [[#53](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/issues/53)]

- Added a reliable mechanism for third-party splitter panels to store extra
  configuration data for child panels that persists through panel copy-and-paste
  operations. [[#52](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/issues/52)]

### Other changes

- Added compatibility with Windows 10 system media transport controls under

  [[#38](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/issues/38)]

- Fixed a bug which caused group heading lines to not be rendered correctly
  after scrolling right. [[#38](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/issues/38)]

- Changed the colour of the insertion marker for drag-and-drop operations in NG
  playlist. It now uses the text colour (previously, it was always black).
  [[#39](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/issues/39)]

### Other changes

- Fixed a problem where auto-hide panels would get stuck open following long
  operations in the UI thread
  [[#35](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/issues/35)]

- Fixed clipped 'Selected item:' text on the Colours tab in the Colours and
  Fonts preferences page.

- Fixed a problem in the NG playlist, playlist switcher and filter panels where
  when a negative vertical item padding was in use, a text cursor would not
  appear when using inline editing. This was fixed by making the text box at
  least as tall as the font.
  [[#45](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/issues/45)]

- Compiled with Visual Studio 2015 Update 3.

## 0.5.0

### Layout and toolbars

- A duplicate preset button has been added to the layout configuration page.
  [[#14](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/issues/14)]

- When the main window is deactivated with the menu bar focused, the focus is
  now restored to the window that had the keyboard focus before the menu bar did
  when the main window is reactivated. (Previously, the focus was incorrectly
  returned to the menu bar.)
  [[#18](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/issues/18)]

- The minimum width of toolbars without an explicit minimum width has been
  reduced to be the same as the minimum height (21 pixels at 100% DPI).

- Improved preferences behaviour when importing FCL files and switching between
  pages; previously preferences may have shown old values after importing an FCL
  file. [[#23](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/issues/23)]

- Panel sizes are now DPI-aware in the standard splitters, and non-auto-size
  columns. In particular, this affects the quick setup presets, FCL files, and
  layouts after the system DPI setting has been changed.
  [[#22](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/issues/22)]
  [[#21](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/issues/21)]

  on some versions of Windows.

- Fixed potentially incorrect sizing of panels when resizing the main window and
  using Playlist tabs without a child panel.

### Filters

- Improved the appearance of Filter search bar icons at some DPI settings.

- Added an option to control whether column titles are shown in Filters.
  [[#28](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/issues/28)]

- Made Filter panels sortable (can be disabled in preferences).
  [[#28](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/issues/28)]

- Reworked Filter preferences and moved them to a separate page.

### Playlist view

- The performance of NG playlist grouping for large playlists has been improved
  on multi-core systems.

- The 'Edit this column' command in the context menu of column titles now
  scrolls to the column in preferences if it is out of view. The command also
  now behaves correctly if the preferences window is already open.

### Other changes

- Corrected truncated 'Size weight' label in Columns tab in Playlist View
  preferences page at some DPI settings.

- Corrected some misbehaviours of the 'active item frame' option in the Colours
  and Fonts preferences page.

- Compiled with Visual Studio 2015 Update 2.

## 0.4.0

### Improved spectrum analyser

Improved spectrum analyser display by using foobar2000's 'New FFT \[behaviour\]
for spectrum-generating methods' and adjusting x- and y-axis logarithmic scales.

Using a linear y-axis is no longer particularly useful and it's recommended that
anyone that was using a linear y-axis switches to a logarithmic y-axis.

### Improved drag and drop behaviour

All standard panels now implement drag images, labels and drop descriptions when
a drag and drop operation is started from them. Currently, the drag image is the
default image provided by the shell, but this may include artwork in the future.
[[#11](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/issues/11)]

You can no longer drop files on panels in the layout area that do not implement
drop handlers (e.g. Console panel and Album list panel).

The default action when dragging files to Windows Explorer is now always copy.
Previously, when dragging files to another folder on the same drive, the default
operation would be to move the files.

When dragging files to the playlist switcher or playlist tabs, you can now force
a new playlist to be created by holding down Alt.

When a new playlist is created by dropping files on the playlist tabs, it will
be created where the files were dropped when possible.

When reordering playlists in the playlist switcher, the insertion point is now
below the item under the pointer when over the bottom half of that item.

Fixed a bug where dragging unsupported objects over some panels would cause the
drag image to get stuck on the edge of the panel.

Fixed a bug where dragging a file from Windows Explorer to foobar2000 near the
right-edge of the screen would cause the drop description label to jump about.

### Improved auto-hide panel behaviour

If a drag-and-drop operation is started from a auto-hide panel, or a panel in an
auto-hide splitter, it no longer immediately hides itself. In particular, this
allows things like reordering playlists in an auto-hide playlist switcher.

Resizing a hidden auto-hide panel would sometimes cause it to get stuck open.
This has been fixed. [[#8](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/issues/8)]

### Splitter divider width is now configurable

[[#10](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/issues/10)]

The setting is on the Layout preferences page.

### Improved high-DPI behaviour

[[#16](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/issues/16)]
[[#9](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/issues/9)]

The default values of the following are now DPI-aware:

- Splitter divider width
- Columns/NG playlist vertical item padding
- Playlist switcher vertical item padding
- Filter panel vertical item padding
- NG playlist artwork column width

Additionally, when transferring those settings to another PC via FCL files, or
when changing the system DPI, the values will automatically be scaled
appropriately.

Similar changes will be made for other settings in an upcoming version.

### Other bug fixes

- If you sort by a column in NG Playlist, this can now be undone using the Undo
  command.
- Fixed various truncated text labels in various dialogs on certain DPI
  settings.
- Corrected the behaviour of the up and down buttons for the auto-hide show and
  hide delay settings in preferences.
- Added a workaround for an OS bug that could cause the main menu to be
  incorrectly activated when foobar2000 was alt-tabbed out of and a global
  keyboard shortcut using Ctrl+Alt was used to activate the foobar2000 window.
- When the main menu is focused (by pressing Alt or F10), F10 can now correctly
  be used to deactivate the menu.
- Fixed a bug where if foobar2000 was minimised to a notification icon, and you
  then hid the notification icon in preferences, you would be left with no
  notification icon and no visible window.
- Fixed odd behaviour of centre- and right-alignment in Item details when word
  wrapping was off. [[#17](https://github.com/reupen/columns_ui/issues/17)]
- Fixed incorrect inclusion of trailing spaces on lines in Item details when
  word wrapping was on.
